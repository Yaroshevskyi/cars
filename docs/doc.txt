We'd like you to build simple REST API for us - a basic cars makes and models database interacting with external API. Here's full specification of endpoints that we'd like it to have:

POST /cars
* Request body should contain car make and model name
* Based on this data, its existence should be checked here https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/
* If the car doesn't exist - return an error
* If the car exists - it should be saved in the database

POST /rate
* Add a rate for a car from 1 to 5

GET /cars
* Should fetch list of all cars already present in application database with their current average rate

GET /popular
* Should return top cars already present in the database ranking based on number of rates (not average rate values, it's important!)

 

Rules & hints

1.      Your goal is to implement REST API in Django, however you're free to use any third-party libraries and database of your choice, but please share your reasoning behind choosing them.

2.      At least basic tests of endpoints and their functionality are obligatory. Their exact scope and form is left up to you.

3.      The application's code should be kept in a public repository so that we can read it, pull it and build it ourselves. Remember to include README file or at least basic notes on application requirements and setup - we should be able to easily and quickly get it running.

4.      Please dockerize your application and use docker-compose or similar solution.

5.      Written application must be hosted and publicly available for us online - we recommend Heroku.
